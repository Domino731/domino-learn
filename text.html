<div>
    <p>When we create a website, its most important thing is the content on this page. We often want to give some meaning to the text
        - underline, cross out, bold.Giving meaning to the text will attract the user's attention. </p>
    <p> In the text editor, we can easily cross out text or write in italics. In HTML there are over a hundred tags to
        format our text. Full list can be found at <a
            href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#text-level-semantics" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"> html.spec.whatwg.org</a>. However, usually only these basic tags are used. Below
        is a list of them. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> - makes the text bold. It marks the fragment of text that you want to draw attention
            to and gives it a semantic meaning.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> - like the above, it boldens the text but doesn't give it semantic meaning.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;i&gt;</code> - makes the text that is in it become slanted. Can be used for technical words or
            names.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;small&gt;</code> - used to shrink text. Most commonly found in the footer of a page, e.g. for
            license text.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;del&gt;</code> - text surrounded by this tag becomes crossed out.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;span&gt;</code> - is a tag that does not give any meaning to the text, it is a very useful tag for
            styling in CSS.</li>
    </ul>
